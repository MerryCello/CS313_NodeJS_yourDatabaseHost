# Your Database Host

The final product of this project should give the user the ability to create their own database using a web based UI.
The idea is that this site will host your database.

## What it actually does

In this project, you can sign up and edit a sample database that is already created for a given user.

[Run the app here](https://your-database-host.herokuapp.com/)
